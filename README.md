 This is my informative blog site about man's best friend. You'll find cute pictures, resurces for new owners and all kinds of information you may not have known!

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Bootstrap4 - great css framework
- Sass - syntactically awesome style sheets
- JavaScript - scripting/programming language that allows you to implement complex features
